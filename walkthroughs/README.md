## Walkthrough

*Each day contains:*

* a README with instructions to following if you're performing the walkthrough on your own. 
* a PDF of the slides used during the presentation.
* presenter notes for whoever may choose to give the presentation.
 
The first few days will be discussion about core concepts followed by how to start setting up our FakeFlix Movie app. As the days progress, application code and concepts will start blending together and we can more quickly build up our application.
