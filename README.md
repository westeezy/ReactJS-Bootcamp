## ReactJS Bootcamp

###How to Run the App
First, make sure you have [Node.js] installed ([npm] is Node's companion package manager). This application was built using Node 0.12, but it should work fine with most versions of Node and [io.js].

See these instructions for help [installing Node].

In the terminal, run `npm install` to pull in dependencies, followed by `npm start` to start the webpack dev server which will open a Chrome window.

### Bootcamp Start
Bootcamp starts on a stripped down version of the master branch to start building up the application from scratch. Please see branch [ndc_day_one].
